One heuristic good as Min-Fill-Order is Weighted-Min-Fill.

In Weighted-Min-Fill the cost of removing a node is represented by the sum of all the weights of the edges that need to be added 
to the graph due to its elimination. 

But the cost for each edge is not only 1, as in Min-Fill-Order, but it is the product of the weights 
of the constituent nodes of the edge that should be added.

The main difference in these two heuristic is that in Weighted-Min-Fill we consider the weight that actually each neighbor node insert in the 
elimination of the starting node. We want to minimize this cost because it means that we are pruning the most useless vertex in the graph.This lead to 
removing heavier nodes, with less cost, in the following iterations.
